## How It Works

LinkedAuto uses Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of sending connection requests on LinkedIn. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it operates:

1. **Selenium Setup**: The script initializes a Selenium WebDriver instance, which controls a Chrome browser.
2. **Login Process**: It navigates to the LinkedIn login page, inputs your credentials, and logs in.
3. **Search Functionality**: The script performs a search based on the specified keywords, retrieving profiles that match.
4. **Sending Requests**: It iterates through the search results, sending connection requests to each profile.
5. **Error Handling**: If it encounters any issues, the script logs the errors for review.

### Example Workflow

- **User Input**: The user specifies keywords like "Software Engineer" or "Data Scientist."
- **Automated Actions**: LinkedAuto finds profiles matching these keywords and sends connection requests.
- **Results**: Users can check their LinkedIn account to see new connection requests sent.
